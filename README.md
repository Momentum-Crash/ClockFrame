The Driver file is used for driving the program of a clock, adding time to it via basic functions that allow users to increment the time. 
It starts off by grabbing the current system time then allows a user to add time to that system time.
Users can input 1, 2, 3, or 4 to access different functions.
Option 1, 2, and 3 access adding a second, minute, and hour respectively.
Option 4 is only used to exit the program and lets the user know first that it's ending the program.

The program itself is rather basic and doesn't have a whole lot of flavor to it, but it did teach me how to work with time datatypes in C++. It also taught me how to work with continually updating screens using clear for the first time. I believe that the biggest improvements to this project would be to implement a way to properly switch AM to PM and PM to AM (currently it's lacking that feature) and to allow users to input different times to adjust the clock by both going up and down. Currently the clock only increments time and doesn't have a way to decrement it.
