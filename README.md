The Driver file is used for driving the program of a clock, adding time to it via basic functions that allow users to increment the time. 
It starts off by grabbing the current system time then allows a user to add time to that system time.
Users can input 1, 2, 3, or 4 to access different functions.
Option 1, 2, and 3 access adding a second, minute, and hour respectively.
Option 4 is only used to exit the program and lets the user know first that it's ending the program.
